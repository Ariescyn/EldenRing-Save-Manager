# EldenRing-Save-Manager
GUI app written entirely in Python.


When making a quick save or backup:
  1. Exit game or go to main menu (just dont sign in after the Bandai Namco screen)
  2. alt-tab, click file > save backup
  3. Make sure the Game is exited or at the main menu (dont sign in) and alt-tab, file > restore backup


Creating save slots to easily store and load various builds before RESPEC, etc.
  
  - When creating a save slot, enter a name for the save and click 'Done'. It will then appear in the list box.
  - This will copy the contents of your appdata/roaming/EldenRing folder and back it up for easy retrieval.
  - Simply select the save slot you want to load into the game and click 'Load Save'.
  - To delete a save slot, select the slot and click 'Delete Save'.
  - Right-click on a save slot to edit notes. Notepad will open and allow you to enter details related to the save, like rune count, levels etc.




This is my first GUI app and have been using it since release. Figured i would share it with all the issues of people losing their progress. i would love suggestions/advice! Email me at scyntacks94@gmail.com

The exe was compiled with pyinstaller and windows defender will most likely report it as untrusted. Just click more info > run anyway. This is a known issue and i am actively working on it. If you don't feel comfortable downloading then wait a couple days and it should be fixed. If anyone can help, please contact me.

I can easily modify this program to work with dark souls 3 or other games. Just let me know.
NOTE: Never use someone elses save file or you'll get banned.
