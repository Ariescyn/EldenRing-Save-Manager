NOTE: I removed the update application from the newest release since it was being detected as a virus and it is now an optional download.
You can still check for updates within the save manager, but will have to be manually downloaded from GitHub.

Quick Backup and Restore when you dont need to make a save slot:
  
  1. Make sure you are at the main menu (after bandai namco screen and before you login to elden ring servers) or exit the game.
  2. click file > save backup.
  3. Load into the game and do as you wish.
  4. Repeat step 1.
  4. click file > restore backup.


Creating save slots to easily store and load various builds before RESPEC, etc.
  
  - When creating a save slot, enter a name for the save and click 'Done'. It will then appear in the list box.
  - This will copy the contents of your appdata/roaming/EldenRing folder and save a copy to data/save-files up for easy retrieval.
  - Simply select the save slot you want to load into the game and click 'Load Save'.
  - To delete a save slot, select the slot and click 'Delete Save'.
  - Right-click on a save slot to edit notes. Notepad will open and allow you to enter details related to the save, like rune count, levels etc.
  - Right-click on a save slot to rename a save file. Enter a new name and press Done. NOTE: Some characters are forbidden in save slot names. example: "~'{};:./\,:*?<>|-!@#$%^&()+
  - Right-click on a save slot to update a save slot. This will copy the contents of your most current save file in appdata/roaming/EldenRing and overwrite the      selected save slot.

You can use this icon to replace the horrible default Elden Ring game icon.
