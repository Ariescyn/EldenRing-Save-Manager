1. Click on a save file in the left listbox, then click Select
2. From the dropdown menu, click on the character you want to copy
3. Do the same on the right hand side
4. Click Copy


- You cannot copy to a save file that has duplicate character names!
  If you already have a save file with duplicate names, copy the character to a save file that doesn't.


- If you only have one character in save, you can only overwite that character. 
  Simply go ingame and create a new character and then you can overwrite it with whatever you want.


- After copying a character, when you go to load your character in the game, the level/location/playtime will not have updated. 
  Once you load into the character for the first time, it will update and be correct the next time you go to load.


- If you previously deleted a character within the game, the game still keeps that character in the save file but you cant see it.
  Because of this, characters deleted this way will still appear in the dropdown list! Go in-game and create a character and the slot will be usable again.
