Creating save slots to easily store and load various builds before RESPEC, etc:
  
  - When creating a save slot, enter a name for the save and click 'Done'. It will then appear in the list box.
  - This will copy the contents of your appdata/roaming/EldenRing folder and save a copy to data/save-files up for easy retrieval.
  - Simply select the save slot you want to load into the game and click 'Load Save'.
  - To delete a save slot, select the slot and click 'Delete Save'.
  - Right-click on a save slot to edit notes. Notepad will open and allow you to enter details related to the save, like rune count, levels etc.
  - Right-click on a save slot to rename a save file. Enter a new name and press Done. NOTE: Some characters are forbidden in save slot names. example: "~'{};:./\,:*?<>|-!@#$%^&()+
  - Right-click on a save slot to update a save slot. This will copy the contents of your most current save file in appdata/roaming/EldenRing and overwrite the selected save slot.
  

Update the application:
  
  - Click Edit > Check for updates to see if your version is the latest. If you would like to update, close the save manager and run the update.exe



Changing the savegame directory (If it's NOT already installed at the default location of appdata/roaming/EldenRing:  
  
  - Click Edit > Change default directory and select your "EldenRing" folder, NOT the folder thats named after your 17 digit Steam ID.



Character renaming:
	
   Note: If two or more Characters in your save file have the same name, both names will be overwritten with the new name. 
	 To circumvent this limitation, copy one of the duplicate named characters to a save file with no duplicates. 
	 (Sorry for this, but the some of the locations and occurences of names in save file do not seem to be static so i must replace ALL occurences of a specified name.)
