Ability to manually search for your own item IDs and add them to your manager (Go to inventory editor > Custom Items)
Fixed bug when a character name is the substring of the other e.g. "gone" and "gone32". Trying to rename "gone" would also rename "gone32"
Fixed bug with import window not disappearing after clicking Done
Fixed bug preventing some save files from being imported
Added Donate button (Any support would be appreciated! This is the first program i've written and have hundreds of hours invested)
